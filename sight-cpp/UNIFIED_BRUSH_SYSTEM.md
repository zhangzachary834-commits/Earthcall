## Key Features

### üé® Brush Types

#### Normal Brush
- Standard painting with customizable opacity and flow
- Smooth, predictable strokes
- Ideal for base colors and detailed work

#### Airbrush
- Particle-based spraying effect with density control
- Realistic airbrush simulation
- Perfect for gradients and soft transitions

#### Chalk
- Textured brush with randomized opacity for natural look
- Simulates traditional chalk media
- Great for artistic textures and rough surfaces

#### Spray
- Spray can effect with random particle distribution
- High-density particle spraying
- Ideal for graffiti-style effects and texture creation

#### Smudge
- Blends existing colors for realistic smudging
- Color mixing and blending effects
- Perfect for realistic painting and color transitions

#### Clone
- Copies texture from one area to another
- Professional cloning tool with offset control
- Essential for texture repair and pattern creation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Dynamics

#### Opacity Control
- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- Controls brush transparency
- Lower values create more transparent strokes

#### Flow Control
- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- Controls paint flow rate
- Affects how quickly paint builds up

#### Spacing Control
- **Range**: 0.01 - 0.5
- Distance between brush dabs in strokes
- Lower values create smoother, more continuous strokes

#### Density Control
- **Range**: 0.1 - 1.0
- Particle density for airbrush effects
- Higher values create more concentrated effects

#### Strength Control
- **Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
- Intensity of smudge and other effects
- Controls the power of blending and mixing

### üéØ Pressure Simulation

The system simulates pressure sensitivity based on mouse movement speed:

- **Enable Pressure**: Toggle pressure sensitivity on/off
- **Sensitivity**: How much mouse speed affects pressure (0.1 - 5.0)
- **Current Pressure**: Manual pressure override (0.1 - 1.0)

#### How It Works
- Faster mouse movement = lower pressure (thinner strokes)
- Slower mouse movement = higher pressure (thicker strokes)
- Provides natural, responsive painting experience

### üñåÔ∏è Stroke Interpolation

- **Stroke Interpolation**: Smooth stroke rendering between mouse positions
- **Brush Cursor**: Visual cursor showing brush position and size
- **Brush Preview**: Real-time preview of brush settings

#### Benefits
- Eliminates jagged strokes from discrete mouse positions
- Creates smooth, continuous brush strokes
- Professional-quality line rendering

### üèóÔ∏è Layer System

#### Multiple Layers
- Create and manage unlimited texture layers
- Each layer has independent opacity and blend mode
- Non-destructive editing workflow

#### Layer Opacity
- Control individual layer transparency (0.0 - 1.0)
- Real-time opacity adjustment
- Layer-specific transparency control

#### Blend Modes
1. **Normal**: Standard alpha blending
2. **Multiply**: Darkens underlying colors
3. **Screen**: Lightens underlying colors
4. **Overlay**: Contrast enhancement
5. **Add**: Brightens colors
6. **Subtract**: Darkens colors

### üìã Brush Presets

Pre-configured brush settings for common tasks:

#### Soft Brush
- Gentle painting with low opacity
- Smooth, gradual color application
- Perfect for subtle shading and blending

#### Hard Brush
- Sharp, opaque strokes
- High opacity and flow
- Ideal for bold lines and solid colors

#### Airbrush
- Professional airbrush simulation
- Optimized for gradients and soft effects
- Realistic particle distribution

#### Chalk
- Textured, natural media look
- Randomized opacity for organic feel
- Great for artistic textures

#### Smudge
- Color blending tool
- Optimized for mixing and blending
- Realistic paint mixing simulation

#### Clone
- Texture copying tool
- Professional cloning capabilities
- Essential for texture repair

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo/Redo System

- **Undo (Ctrl+Z)**: Revert last brush stroke
- **Redo (Ctrl+Y)**: Restore undone stroke
- **Clear History**: Remove all stroke history
- **Stroke-level undo**: Undo individual strokes, not just entire operations
