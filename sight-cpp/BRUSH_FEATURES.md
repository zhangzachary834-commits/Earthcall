# Enhanced 3D Face Brush Tool Features

## Overview
The 3D face brush tool has been significantly enhanced to provide professional-grade painting capabilities for 3D objects. This system allows for precise texture painting on cube faces with advanced brush dynamics and effects.

## Key Features

### üé® Brush Types
- **Normal Brush**: Standard painting with customizable opacity and flow
- **Airbrush**: Particle-based spraying effect with density control
- **Chalk**: Textured brush with randomized opacity for natural look
- **Spray**: Spray can effect with random particle distribution
- **Smudge**: Blends existing colors for realistic smudging
- **Clone**: Copies texture from one area to another

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Dynamics
- **Opacity**: Controls brush transparency (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Flow**: Controls paint flow rate (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Spacing**: Distance between brush dabs in strokes (0.01 - 0.5)
- **Density**: Particle density for airbrush effects (0.1 - 1.0)
- **Strength**: Intensity of smudge and other effects (0.0 - 1.0)

### üéØ Pressure Simulation
- **Enable Pressure**: Toggle pressure sensitivity
- **Sensitivity**: How much mouse speed affects pressure (0.1 - 5.0)
- **Current Pressure**: Manual pressure override (0.1 - 1.0)

### üñåÔ∏è Stroke Interpolation
- **Stroke Interpolation**: Smooth stroke rendering between mouse positions
- **Brush Cursor**: Visual cursor showing brush position and size
- **Brush Preview**: Real-time preview of brush settings

### üèóÔ∏è Layer System
- **Multiple Layers**: Create and manage texture layers
- **Layer Opacity**: Control individual layer transparency
- **Blend Modes**: 
  - Normal: Standard alpha blending
  - Multiply: Darkens underlying colors
  - Screen: Lightens underlying colors
  - Overlay: Contrast enhancement
  - Add: Brightens colors
  - Subtract: Darkens colors

### üìã Brush Presets
Pre-configured brush settings for common tasks:
- **Soft Brush**: Gentle painting with low opacity
- **Hard Brush**: Sharp, opaque strokes
- **Airbrush**: Professional airbrush simulation
- **Chalk**: Textured, natural media look
- **Smudge**: Color blending tool
- **Clone**: Texture copying tool

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo/Redo System
- **Undo (Ctrl+Z)**: Revert last brush stroke
- **Redo (Ctrl+Y)**: Restore undone stroke
- **Clear History**: Remove all stroke history

### üéÆ Controls

#### Basic Usage
1. Select "Face Brush" mode in the 3D panel
2. Choose a brush type from the dropdown
3. Adjust basic settings (radius, softness, opacity)
4. Click and drag on cube faces to paint

#### Advanced Features
- **Clone Tool**: 
  1. Select Clone brush type
  2. Enable "Clone Active"
  3. Set source point with "Set Source Point" button
  4. Paint to copy from source area

- **Layer Management**:
  1. Enable "Use Layers"
  2. Use "Add Layer" to create new layers
  3. Adjust layer opacity and blend mode
  4. Paint on different layers for non-destructive editing

- **Pressure Simulation**:
  1. Enable "Enable Pressure"
  2. Adjust sensitivity to your preference
  3. Paint with varying mouse speed to see pressure effects

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo last stroke
- **Ctrl+Y**: Redo last undone stroke
- **Mouse Drag**: Paint strokes
- **Mouse Click**: Single brush dabs

### üé® Professional Workflow Tips

1. **Start with Presets**: Use the built-in presets as starting points
2. **Layer Organization**: Use layers for different elements (base color, details, highlights)
3. **Pressure Control**: Use pressure simulation for natural brush strokes
4. **Brush Cursor**: Keep brush cursor enabled for precise positioning
5. **Stroke Interpolation**: Enable for smooth, continuous strokes
6. **Undo Frequently**: Use Ctrl+Z to experiment freely

### üîß Technical Details

#### Texture Resolution
- Default texture size: 64x64 pixels per face
- Supports RGBA8 color format
- Automatic mipmap generation for smooth rendering

#### Performance
- Optimized for real-time painting
- Efficient stroke interpolation
- Minimal memory usage with layer system

#### Compatibility
- Works with all primitive types (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone)
- Compatible with existing face painting system
- Preserves backward compatibility

### üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Higher resolution textures
- Custom brush shapes
- Brush texture support
- Advanced stroke dynamics
- Texture export/import
- Brush stroke recording and playback
